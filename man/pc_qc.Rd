\arguments{
\item{qc_type}{Specific QC steps to perform (
select from "all" or "sum_only")}

\item{ld}{A list of phenocycler segmentation results containing summary data
and segmented cells.}

\item{col_nums1}{Vector of column numbers to include from segmentation
summary data.}

\item{md_var}{Vector for renaming summary data column names.}

\item{md_num}{Number of metadata columns in exported cell segmentation
results. Only used if qc_type is "all".}

\item{samp_id}{Sample ID column name.}

\item{g_col}{(optional) Add a column providing grouping information.}

\item{g_col2}{(optional) Add a column providing grouping information.}

\item{ch_list}{List of channels exported with segmentation results. Note
that the channel list must match the order of channels included within
the results.}

\item{col_nums2}{If qc_type is "all", indicate the column number to
use as the sample ID as well as the X and Y coordinates
for formatting the segmentation results table.}

\item{ch_nuc}{Nuclei channel name.}
}
\value{
List containing QC summary statistics and plots.
